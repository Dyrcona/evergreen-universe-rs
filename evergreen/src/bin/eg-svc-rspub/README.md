# Rust Service Example

## Layout

There is nothing special about the file names here, apart from 'main'.

* main.rs -- service binary entry point
* app.rs -- service definition
* methods.rs -- published methods
  * There would likely be multiple files of API definitions, presumably
    named to suit the purpose of each collection.
